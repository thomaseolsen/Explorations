# Explorations
A journey through different languages, exploring other ways of doing the same thing.

I plan to start with the basics, the ubiquitous "Hello World" in the selection of languages I'm interested in exploring. From there I'll add some basic constructs from my undergrad days and move forward.

As a note to myself, I plan on exploring the following languages:
* Ada
* C++ (my first language)
* C# (my home language)
* COBOL
* D
* Fortran
* Go
* Java
* Javascript
* Objective-C
* Pascal
* Python
* Ruby

Sure, I know what you're thinking. That list is too long to be realistic. I'm hopeful that it is not, and am making it my personal goal to work my way through these languages to become at least familiar enough with them to be able to talk somewhat intelligently in conversation about them. If, by chance, you're thinking the list isn't long enough...well, I bow to your polyglotness and hope to reach your ranks in due time.

## Compilers
I am currently using two compilers in the makefile. They are as follows:

- GCC
  - Ada
  - C++
  - Fortran
  - Go
  - Objective-C
- GDC
  - D
