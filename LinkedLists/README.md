# Linked Lists

## Ada

## C++
This is my base implementation of the Doubly Linked List (DLL). From here, I will translate the idea across the various languages and output the results of traversing the list.

For comparison, I also tested std::list available in the C++ Standard Library. This provides similar functionality built-in. I'll compare the implementation of this library to the other languages as well (where available). This is also an implementation of a DLL, and as such offers fairly equivalent functionality to our jumping off point.
